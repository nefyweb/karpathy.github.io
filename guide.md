| Model        | Description       | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
|Evolution     | It is an evolving science be on the cups of it, notice the changes. Intelligence will change in its heritable characteristics after each successive updated copy. These multiple intelligences will give rise to a higher degree of diversity of intelligence at mutliple levels of organisation. The effects of evolution can change the functional model approximation, the feedback perception and the gradient descent.| 
|Co-evolution    | See what areas are necessary to know to understand and improve the evolution. The idea that two sources of intellIgences together form something recipricol and togther effects eachothers evolution. The combinaltion of convulition networks and deision trees.| 
|Speciation    | Specialised sub-evolutions i.e. species of code will exist, such as python and r, and within that different approaches and tools that take on a life of its own will exist.| 
|Hybrid Vigor    | The idea that with the combination of two things the hybrid offspring is more advanced. The combination of different tools and even languages to the extent that it makes sense and improves.| 
|Survival by Differentiation    | The idea that if you don’t change yourself you will not survive so you are forced to change. Such as forced to swap jobs, forced to use another tools or language otherwise you won’t be at the top anymore.| 
|Natural Selection   | If your tools are more general or more applicable to future changes you will survive for longer, so make your solutions more generally applicable.| 
|Artificial Selection (Invisible Hand)    | You combine two tools of the same characteristics to see if the offspring will be enhanced. The combination of two fast sorting algorithms. The cobination of two classifiers known for speed to improve speed even more.| 
|Sybiosis / Parasite    | The idea that a certain module or function will perform much better that had it bee plucked into another larger program. The idea that some type of program feeds off off the little code produced by the program and performs a great fucntion as the result. It takes a small amount of the trickling of data to perform something amazing.| 
|Mimicry    | Look at how certain programmers do it and mimic them but try to change it up a bit.| 
|Genetic Drift   | Sometimes there might be isolated fields within the field such as a group of programmers that don’t perform the best they do interesting things that might be successfull had they had the eye of someone with more application worthy skills.| 
|Inoculation    | The idea that you give your program a bit of bad code, or a small amount of code to see how it reacts and adapts so that in the future when it is fed bad or a small or any other constrained type of code it easily knows how to handle the issue. You might need some reinforcement learning for that.| 
|Immunity    | That a balanced state exist between rejecting code and executing code to give a result. And that when a resut is produced that a certainty figure is also produced. It is tolerant code and can stop unwanted reactions.| 
|Evolutionary Psychology    | The idea that prgrams such as Kaggle exists as a result of a evolutionary requirement for competition, discovery, reputation, prwer the unknown etc thatt exists within programmers.| 
|Slaves to our brains (food/sex)    | The issue are that we are slaves to our senses, this therefore makes it hard to conceptualise certain things the mind of the machine can achieve. This establises limits to what you can conceptually understand and execute. What you will at some point require is a vast system of analogies to dumb it down to huma intellegence.| 
|Imitation    | Similar to mimicry but focused on the process imitation. So how to do the coding instead of what coding to do.| 
|Hierarchy    | Small units forming the components of larger systems. The binary code forms the browser code, forms the python code, is the tool we use creates the math we use, creates the function the programs the intelligence.| 
|Self-preservation    | Any trait that prevents the code from being destroyed or broken is self preserving. Self preservation has to be an active function of maintenace in the code.| 
|Territoriality/proxemics    | There is an amount of space people feel save to enter and collaborate. Much of your effort would be to find a way in which you can bring prgrammers closer to eachother so that they can feel like one strong brain. So you need to decrease there proxemics. In the same way you should program calssifiers and algorithms to enjoy the colaboration that they are doing.| 
|Ritualistic (Social bonds, identity)   | Ritualistic experiences it important fo the social creatures, but you can also use ritaulaistics and colour experessions for algortighms to communicate with eahother. If some algorithms can communicate in geometry, text, colours it might significantly improve there intelligence.| 
|Food Chains    | The idea that there is always something that would consume you. The idea that that what exist wont exists anymore but would be absorbedd by something bigger, ftp was absorbed by the browser, sckitlearn would be absorbed by python. Python will be absorbed by anotehr language etc.| 
|Swarm Intelligence   | The idea that if you break something down in smaller compenents and give it some form of communication that it can do extermely impressive feats. Use thousands of small neaural networks for simple functions such as changing direction.| 
|Apex predator qualities   | The idea that theere is some things with no preditors. In this category we find Google and we will find general AI. You will struggle to find somethign to beat them because of characteristics such as size, rate of adoption speed and experience.| 
|Superorganism qualities (colony vs agg)    | This is the idea that when a group acts together towards clearly specified goals such as shelter and food they will be able to collaborate more easily. Give programmers simple functions, almost assembely type work. The only issue is conciosness that fights against boredom. Also the se of teams seems important.| 
|Growth and Adaption    | The idea that something that started in biological terms will grow in size and acceptance. If it is given enough resources. The more users i.e. resources the better the software.| 
|Trust and cooperation (Dunbar Number)    | The idea that when you have to interact socially a number of 150 is preferred, any more that that can cause problems. Similarly maybe there is an optimal leel of combination of algorithms after which the performance wades.| 
|Placebo effect & F.E.s eg   | Give the code a fake problem that has no solution and see what type of solution in produces.| 
|Pygmallion Effect    | Higher expectations lead to better results. The idea is that you make code that can do very complex things and then see how the code reacts to a very easy problem.| 

| Model         | Description       | 
| -------------   |-------------| 
|Layered Complexity    | The idea is that simple is not always better, but thatyou have to selectively lay the apt layers of complexity into your products. Simplicity is not the be all and end all.| 
|Colour   | Colour as a means of communication sotrage, easier programming, calssification and visual representtion for sense. The idea that other than visual you can also make use of auditive and physical functions to understand machine learning. Like the sound of a sorting algorithm etc.| 
|Negative Space (Padding)   | The idea that any result you produce should have some padding to make it easier to understand such as rounding, buffers and margins.| 
|Alignment & Proximity    | The idea that different allignment of algorithms and position of algorithms lead to differeent results i.e. the fact that disassociativity is not a value of the process.| 
|Repetition    | Possibly by doing the same thing with slight alterations you will be able to learn a lot.| 
|Contrast   | The ability to follow 4 to 5 contrasting methods and debugging where the different methods outperform eachother and then finding a way to moduliase and combine with that function.| 
|Typography    | This is important for the pgram for human computation interface, the typograhpy has to be great.| 
|Paper Prototyping & Visualisation    | This is super important to gauge the intuition as to what the program is doing.| 
|Light   | Try to shine light on all that you are doing so, having an indepth understanding as to what you are doing.| 
|Composition e.g. rule of 3rds   | See if you can incoporate the rule of 3 in your visualisation.| 
|Design Patterns    | I am of the opinion that ML patterns once drawn out will look alot like design patterns. See if you can rverse design patterns to create ML patterns.| 
|Storytelling   | The idea that there should be astory to tell and that it should be dumbed down to what related to humans, at the end we are only really concerned with humans and human measurements.| 
|Dieter emphasis    | No emphasis the reader creates there own journey whereas with emphasis you are told what to focus on.| 
|Grid System   | Place things in a table or grid so as to easier understand the components. Basically the idea that you should connect and catagorise the compenents you use to create what you want to create.| 
|Simplicity    | The idea is that simplicity and the exeptional craftmanship of smal details can be very successful. So keep the code very easy to understand and as simple as possible. However the underbody can be complex but should not be kept with the parent code, instea it should be functionalised and modulaised.| 
|Form follows function    | The idea is that you want to create asctetically pleasing and simplicitic code, but you should first code just for the function and keep detailedd comments after which you simplify and spruce the code up.| 



| Model         | Description       | 
| -------------   |-------------| 
|Scientific method    | A good approach to conduct research. Look at how Google Research conducts their sceintific research.| 
|Critical Mass   | Look at the minimum amount of knowledge you require to build the best AI programs or win the kaggle competitions. And then the minimum amount of work, lines of code, maintenance, processing and attention. Make what is required as small as required around the critival mass| 
|Tipping point   | Tipping point, this is they idea that a lot of things that require persistance is in a hockey stick shape. The same goes for coding you just have to keep on going, you will soon find yourself in that real of impossibility. The idea is that the singularity itself is a tipping point, but there is many tipping points along the way.| 
|Equilibrium    | The idea is that everything is always in equilibrium or working towards equilibrium. When you make a pieve of code you might find that all the surrounding functions is inequilibrium so be sure to take note that when you effect on function a lot of the functions might infact be affected donw the line. It basically comes own to changing one thing actually changes a lot of things.| 
|Precedence    | The order of things, the fact is that some things are more importnat than others. Make sure that when you edit and chanage things, that you start with the big things first and then work your way down or the other way aroud depending on what your problem is.| 
|Chaos Theory    | Dynamic systems highly sensitive to initial conditions, also referred to as the butterfly effect. Your life is a perfect example of a complex system. The way it starts have an enormouse effect on where you find yourself now. What is interesting about conplex systems is that it is always a compmlex system in a complex system. Maybe therefore, the start of a neural network is the only important part, maybe you only have to adjust the start of the neural network i.e. the input features, the first characteristics and not give a shit about the rest.| 
|Spillover Effect    | There might be some unintended consequences of making certain changes. So keep your eye on all measures even if you did not expect a change or purport a change the change might still occur.| 
|2nd law of thermodynamics   | Entropy and complexity will always increase, elements, carban, human, consciousness. meta consciosunsess - Meta conciousness is the blow that AI will provide. It is too difficult to know what follows that. This therfore also means thtat the complexity of the algortihsm will keep on increasing.| 
|Autocatalysis    | one of the products of the execution is also an execution, hence you can exponentially grow your excutions such as with a neural net.| 
|Atomic    | Everything cna be broken down into attomic constructs. The same holds for breaking down each compuation into matrix notation. Matrices or the atomics building force.| 
|Inertia   | Newtons first law says stuff wont change if you don’t change stuff.| 
|Motion    | Newton’s second law of motion that acceleration happens at the speed of constant focerce times direction. If you keep your mind at a constant speed the progress of the task at hand will accelerate because you hav the multiplier of time.| 
|Equal Oppisite reaction    | The idea that if you succeed in something something or someone fails, if you kick something you could have similarly be kicked where you kicked.| 
|Taxonomy    | Science concerned with classification, meaning that sometimes allyou have to do is classify things to gain a better understanding.| 

| Model         | Description       | 
| -------------   |-------------| 
|Deepity    | A “deepity” is a proposition that seems both important and true–and profound–but that achieves this effect by being ambiguous. " Love is just a word"| 
|Surely    | “Surely” is as good as a blinking light in locating a weak point in the argument| 
|Not making sense    | If that is the majorities point of view then it does make sense, the majority has just not been informed. If it is the minorities view then it does not yet make sense and their is opportunity for further investigation| 
|Jootsing   | When an artistic tradition reaches the point where literally “anything goes,” those who want to be creative have a problem: there are no fixed rules to rebel against, no complacent expectations to shatter, nothing to subvert, no background against which to create something that is both surprising and yet meaningful. It helps to know the tradition if you want to subvert it. That’s why so few dabblers or novices succeed in coming up with anything truly creative.|
